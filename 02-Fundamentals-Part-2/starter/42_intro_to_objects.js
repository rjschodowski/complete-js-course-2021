/*

The big difference between objects and arrays,

is that in objects, the order of these values

does not matter at all when we want to retrieve them.

And that's important to keep in mind.


We should use arrays for more order data,

and objects for more unstructured data.

And data that we actually want to name,

and then retrieve from the object,

based on that name.
