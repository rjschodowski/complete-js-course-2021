// Activating Strict Mode

/*
So strict mode is a special mode

that we can activate in JavaScript,

which makes it easier for us

to write a secure JavaScript code.

And all we have to do to activate strict mode

is to write this string at the beginning of the script:


'use strict';



First - strict mode forbids us to do certain things

Second - it creates visible errors

and the developer console, where in other situations

JavaScript would just fail silently.


//Strict mode reserves certain words for possible future JavaScript usage, and it will create an error message to let you know if you choose a reserved word
